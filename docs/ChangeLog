    Tweaked scripts with updated paths
    
    Eventually these scripts should be fixed or rewritten so that they
    do not have any hardcoded paths.

    Updated the wiki docs from the online version (in prep for the next release)
    
    (Un)fortunately, the previous mechanism for updating the wiki offline
    docs from the online version is completely broken now (due to a segfault
    in an external tool), so a new mechanism was used to download the files.
    The good news is that the number of files and directories that need to
    be downloaded has been reduced considerably.  This is the first cut
    of the wiki sync.

    More Makefile.am cleanup
    
    Details on this commit:
    * Removed even more trace of the old prototype mechanism from the Makefiles.
    * Removed the cleanup of configure scripts which are no longer there (or
      for that matter were never in the same directory as some of these
      Makefiles).
    * Removal of some files from the *CLEANFILES rules which never existed.
    * Line length tweaks and fixes

    Makefile.am cleanup (removal of ChangeLog and Makefile.in files)
    
    Details on this commit:
    * Now that we are no longer storing machine generated ChangeLogs inside
      the git repository, make maintainer-clean should remove the machine
      generated ChangeLogs.  This way nobody accidently edits the ChangeLog.
      Only 7 ChangeLogs are left after a make maintainer-clean (intl, po,
      and one toplevel ChangeLog).
    * Some directories were missing the removal of Makefile.in when make
      maintainer-clean is run.  Only 3 Makefile.in files remain now after
      make maintainer-clean (only in the intl directories).
    * Removed $Id$ tags from some of the Makefiles since we are no longer
      using CVS.
    * Removed some unnecessary ChangeLogs from ever being created (from
      example/gTAG gschem/scripts, and symbol/font).
    
    Note 1: There are still some machine generated files still hanging around,
    but I'm going to leave those alone for now as the .gitignore mechanism
    properly masks those.
    
    Note 2: Made sure that all files that are to be removed in the *CLEANFILES
    lists comes before the #*# otherwise they will be ignored.

    Don't store git-generated ChangeLog files in repository.
    
    Don't store ChangeLog files in the git repository and have to remember
    to update them each time a release is made.  Instead, get `make dist'
    to create the ChangeLogs for you if a git repository is detected.
    
    Note: make distcheck does not pass in this commit.

    Only need a single `AUTHORS' file.
    
    Move the gschem one to the toplevel (adding several missing names on
    the way), and remove most of the others. The `AUTHORS' files in the
    `symbols' and `utils' directories are retained, because they contain
    some useful information.

    whole repository, including the toplevel Makefile.  This commit does
    not compile (what a surprise)!

    Fix autogen.sh scripts to look for AC_CONFIG_HEADER to run autoheader
    
    Since commit #9a7c363c572d32a30fa1522cd7d14b21c2958ca8, the configure
    scripts in gEDA use AC_CONFIG_HEADER, not AM_CONFIG_HEADER
    
    Fixes build problems noted by various users. Identified by Dan McMahill.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Changes to ChangeLog usage.
    
    With actual changes this time.  Old-style changelogs as of gaf 1.0
    (release of 26th June 2007) are moved to ChangeLog-1.0; new (blank)
    ChangeLogs replace them.  A script has been added to the gaf top level
    to allow maintainers to update all the ChangeLog files immediately
    prior to making out a release.
