NAME
       gschem - gEDA/gaf Schematic Capture

SYNOPSIS
       gschem  [-q]  [-v] [-t] [-r rcfilename] [-s scriptfilename] [-o output-
       filename] [-p] [schematic1 ... schematicN]

DESCRIPTION
       gschem is the schematic capture program which is part gEDA  (GPL	 Elec-
       tronic  Design Automation) toolset.  This program is used to draw elec-
       tronic schematics.  Schematics consist of standard symbols  (which  are
       either  part of a standard library or created by the user) which repre-
       sent the various gates  and  components.	  These	 components  are  then
       interconnected  by  nets	 (wires).   Schematics	may  be	 printed  to a
       PostScript file for printing or further conversion to other output for-
       mats.

       gschem is also the symbol creation editor.  All the standard methods of
       creating schematics are used in the creation of symbols.	 There	are  a
       few  special  rules when creating symbols, so please refer to the (non-
       existant as of now) symbol creation document.

       Please read the official documentation (very minimal at this point)  on
       how  to use gschem, since this man page just describes the command line
       arguments and a few examples on how to run gschem.


OPTIONS
       gschem accepts the following options:

       -q      Quiet mode on.  This mode  turns	 off  all  warnings/notes/mes-
	       sages. (optional)

       -v      Verbose	mode on.  This mode gives as much feedback to the user
	       as possible. (optional)

       -t      Print out more information when using mouse strokes.  With this
	       command	line  flag  and the middle button configured for mouse
	       strokes, gschem will output the stroke sequence numbers as  the
	       user executes strokes.  These numbers can be used to define new
	       strokes in the system-gschemrc file.

       -r filename
	       Specify a rc filename.  Normally gschem searches for  the  sys-
	       tem-gschemrc, then ~/.gEDA/gschemrc, and finally for a gschemrc
	       in the current directory.  This	options	 allows	 the  user  to
	       specify an additional rc file which is read after all the other
	       rc files are read. (optional)

       -s filename
	       Specify a guile script to be executed at startup. (optional)

       -o filename
	       Specify a filename for postscript output.   This	 command  line
	       argument	 is useful when running gschem from a shell script and
	       with a guile script.  The filename can be changed  through  the
	       print dialog box.

       -p      Automatically  place  the  window, especially useful if running
	       gschem from the command line and generating output.

       schematic1 [... schematicN]
	       Schematic file to be loaded.  Specifing	a  schematic  file  is
	       optional.   If  multiple schematic files are specified they are
	       read in sequentially and put on seperate pages.	It  is	impor-
	       tant that the schematic(s) follow all the options (ie last).


EXAMPLES
       These  examples	assume that you have a schematic called stack_1.sch in
       the current directory

       To run gschem and then interact with the program:

	    ./gschem

       To run gschem in interactive mode but load a sample schematic:

	    ./gschem adders_1.sch

       To run gschem and load up all schematics in the current subdirectory:

	    ./gschem *.sch


ENVIRONMENT
       No environment variables are used.
