<p>
gEDA is run by volunteers, so these are volunteer (read: unpaid) tasks. Please consider helping out. Thank you.

<div class="level2">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Documentation Writers/Editors</strong><br/>
Somebody is needed to act as an editor for the gEDA documentation effort. Basically this person would take whatever documentation already exists and/or is currently being written and formats it into something presentable. This individual does not write the actual documentation, but would instead perform editorial work. People who want to write the actual documentation are also needed. (The <a href="start.html" class="wikilink1" title="start.html">start</a> page explains how to get started editing the documentation on the wiki).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>PCB Publicity Manager</strong><br/>
Somebody is needed to do publicity for the gEDA project. This consists of posting release updates to the various PCB design websites (such as <a href="http://CircuitCalculator.com/" class="urlextern" title="http://CircuitCalculator.com/"  rel="nofollow">http://CircuitCalculator.com/</a> , <a href="http://www.olimex.com/pcb/dtools.html" class="urlextern" title="http://www.olimex.com/pcb/dtools.html"  rel="nofollow"> Olimex</a>, <a href="http://www.4pcb.com/index.php?load=content&amp;page_id=46" class="urlextern" title="http://www.4pcb.com/index.php?load=content&amp;page_id=46"  rel="nofollow"> Advanced Circuits</a>, <a href="http://opencircuits.com/Techniques" class="urlextern" title="http://opencircuits.com/Techniques"  rel="nofollow"> Open Circuits</a>, <a href="http://www.ePanorama.net/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.ePanorama.net/"  rel="nofollow">http://www.ePanorama.net/</a> , <a href="http://docwiki.gumstix.org/" class="urlextern" title="http://docwiki.gumstix.org/"  rel="nofollow"> gumstix</a>, <a href="http://reprap.org/bin/view" class="urlextern" title="http://reprap.org/bin/view"  rel="nofollow"> RepRap</a>, etc.)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Linux Publicity Manager</strong><br/>
Somebody is needed to do publicity for the gEDA project. This consists of posting release updates to the various Linux/Unix websites (like <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net" class="urlextern" title="http://www.freshmeat.net"  rel="nofollow"> Freshmeat</a> or <a href="http://LWN.net/" class="urlextern" title="http://LWN.net/"  rel="nofollow"> LWN</a> or <a href="http://LinuxRobots.org/" class="urlextern" title="http://LinuxRobots.org/"  rel="nofollow">http://LinuxRobots.org/</a> )</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>UNIX Port Testers</strong><br/>
People are always needed to test gEDA on different and new UNIX like operating systems. This person would basically download a new release and make sure it works on their platform of choice. Any problems found would be then submitted to the appropriate gEDA author.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Website/Mirror Hacker</strong><br/>
Somebody to watch over the mirrors and maybe do some <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> hacking is needed. There are currently three websites which need to be monitored and occasionally fixed. The person would also have influence in the changing/expansion of the gEDA website. Duties would be split among the current webmasters.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/smileys/fixme.gif" align="middle" alt="FIXME" />: <code>Should this list be combined with <a href="geda-todos.html" class="wikilink1" title="geda-todos.html">todos</a> ?</code>
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Netlist Hacker</strong><br/>
Somebody who is familiar with the generation/management of netlists is needed to help work on and improve gnetlist. Whether the existing gnetlist is used or if a total rewrite is needed is always an open option. Must be extremely familiar with UNIX/C/C++ programming.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Symbol Library Hacker</strong><br/>
Somebody is needed to help get the symbol library up to the current symbol <acronym title="specification">spec</acronym>. This individual would also help in the integration of new symbols and making sure that they meet the current symbol <acronym title="specification">spec</acronym>. The task of getting the symbol library up to <acronym title="specification">spec</acronym> is a combination of manual effort and automated updating (this sort of automated updating lends itself very well to a person with shell/perl scripting familiarity).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>geda <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> Hacker</strong><br/>
Somebody who knows C, UNIX, and GTK+ programming is needed to work on the gEDA <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> (the program named geda). This program has been stalled for the past year due to the lack of manpower. Whether the existing geda is used or a total rewrite is needed is always an open option.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Windows Port Hacker/Manager</strong><br/>
Somebody with expertise building and testing gEDA on UNIX systems and familiarity with the <acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> Windows 95/98/NT platform is needed to manage the gEDA Windows port. Testing, bug fixing, packaging, and releasing of gEDA on the Windows platform would be the primary responsibility of this person. This task requires a person who knows C, GTK+, UNIX, and <acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> Windows programming. The Windows port will NOT move forward if this task is not filled.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>MacOS port manager</strong><br/>
Have the issues mentioned in <a href="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/pcbtools" class="urlextern" title="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/pcbtools"  rel="nofollow"> &quot;Laying out printed circuit boards with open-source tools&quot;</a> been fixed already?</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Release Hacker</strong><br/>
Somebody who wants to create and manage releases is needed. Releases occur when the code is ready to be released, so there&#039;s no marketing pressure. This task requires gEDA building/testing familiarity as well perhaps some minor code hacking.</div>
</li>
</ul>
