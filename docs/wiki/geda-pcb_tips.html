<div class="level2">

<p>
As new features are added to the file format, older versions of pcb might choke on portions of the layout using the bright new features. To prevent this kind of misbehavior, the pcb file contains a note on the minimum version string for the binary. Older versions of pcb refuse to load a layout saved by a newer pcb binary. This was the case for the addition of holes in polygons in 2010. You need a pcb that was compiled from source later than June 2010 to open these layouts.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, there is no way to save the layout in a way that allows older versions of pcb to read the file. However, if don&#039;t use the holes in polygon features, you can just hand-edit the file version header back to 20070407 and  open the file with the older pcb binary.

<div class="level2">

<p>
Probably you try to delete a selected object. In pcb the delete button does not act on the selection, but on the object currently under the mouse. Consequently nothing will be deleted if an object is selected and the mouse hovers at some other place. Bottom line: Just position the mouse over an object and press the delete button. No need to select the object.
</p>

<p>
However, you can delete the current selection with the backspace key.

<p>
Most probably the object is locked.  Locked objects won&#039;t highlight. To see, whether it indeed is, <strong><em>Select all connected objects</em></strong> from the <strong><em>Select</em></strong> menu. Locked footprints are shown with a little L at their diamond shaped insertion mark. Use the lock tool to unlock the object in question. Note, that the lock tool always toggles the lock state of the object you click at. Afterward, an object report pops up that contains the lock state in the last line.
</p>

<p>
If you want to remove all locks, you may consider to remove all instances of the string <code>lock</code> in the *.pcb file with your favorite ascii editor.  
</p>

<p>
A different reason for numb objects is “Only Names” in the settings menu. When checked, the selection tool will exclusively act on text. This is useful with crammed layouts. There is a complementary setting “Lock Names”, too.

<div class="level2">

<p>
PCB supports two entirely separate footprint library mechanisms:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The first is referred to as the “oldlib”, “pcblib”, or the “M4 library”. This system uses the macro language M4 to generate footprints on the fly. The M4 library is fairly large.  A powerful feature of the m4 library is that an entire family of footprints can quickly be defined by defining an appropriate base macro.  Several standard families of footprints exist in pcblib.  Starting with the pcb-20070208 snapshot, the entire m4 library is available as “newlib” footprints (see the following paragraph) under the name “pcblib-newlib”.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The second footprint library for PCB is called the “newlib”. Newlib footprints are defined using <acronym title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</acronym> text files which call out each graphical primitive which makes up an entire footprint.  Newlib footprints can either be created graphically using PCB or via any other method which can produce a text file (text editor, awk/perl/ruby script, etc.).  The use of a scripting or programming language is especially powerful because you can generate large footprints or families of footprints.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Therefore, during layout, you can use footprints which are distributed with
PCB, you can find footprints via a web search, or you can create your own, and
put them in a dedicated directory. <a href="http://pcb.geda-project.org/pcb-cvs/pcb.html" class="urlextern" title="http://pcb.geda-project.org/pcb-cvs/pcb.html"  rel="nofollow">The pcb manual</a> has complete and up to date documentation for the element file format.  <a href="http://gedasymbols.org" class="urlextern" title="http://gedasymbols.org"  rel="nofollow">Gedasymbols.org</a> has a number of user contributed footprints.

<p>
This question is a common one amongst new gEDA users. Indeed, helping newbies determine the appropriate footprint names lies at the core of the ongoing <a href="geda-faq-gschem.html#what_s_this_business_about_heavy_vs._light_symbols" class="wikilink1" title="geda-faq-gschem.html">light vs. heavy symbol</a> debate. In the current, light symbol gEDA/gaf distribution, you need to attach the footprint attribute at the schematic level (i.e. using either gschem or gattrib). The name of the footprint to use depends upon whether you are using the newlib or the M4 library (pcblib).
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT417 SECTION "I want to use PCB to do layout. How do I know what value to use for the footprint attribute?" [7229-7852] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit418"><a name="newlib" id="newlib">Newlib</a></h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
The newlib stores one footprint per file, and the footprint names used by the newlib are the file names of the footprint files.
</p>

<p>
There are several ways to determine the newlib footprint names to use:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You can browse the available footprints by running pcb and opening the footprint library window (available from the menu bar via <strong><em>Window</em></strong> → <strong><em>Library</em></strong>). Click on the “newlib” library group, and then select a sublibrary to browse its symbols. The name of each footprint appears in the <strong>Elements</strong> window on the right hand side of the footprint library browser. Use the name exactly as it appears in the browser for the footprint attribute in gschem or gattrib.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The newlib footprints distributed with PCB are stored in the directories under <strong><code>${PREFIX}/share/pcb/newlib</code></strong>. (<strong><code>${PREFIX}</code></strong> is the install directory you specified when configuring/building PCB.) The name to stick in the “footprint” attribute is the filename of the footprint you wish to use.<br/>
For example, on my machine I installed gEDA with the prefix <strong><code>/usr/local/geda/</code></strong>. The 0805 package (for SMT resistors or caps) lives in a file with absolute path<br/>
<strong><code>/usr/local/geda/share/pcb/newlib/generic_SMD_packages/0805_reflow_solder</code></strong> <br/>
Therefore, to use this footprint on a component I set its “footprint” attribute to <strong><code>0805_reflow_solder</code></strong> using gschem or gattrib.<br/>
Note that if the newlib symbol you want to use lives in a non-standard directory, gsch2pcb needs you to specify a path to that directory, either within your project.rc file (if you use one) or using the <strong><code>--elements-dir</code></strong> flag (from the command line).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Finally, since each new design typically requires you to draw at least a couple of new footprints, it’s likely you will have a local “footprints” directory. As previously, the footprint name to use is the filename you assign to each of your new footprints. Again, don’t forget to add a line to your project.rc file telling gsch2pcb where to find your local footprints. Alternately, you can run gsch2pcb with the <strong><code>--elements-dir</code></strong> flag set to point to your local footprint directory.</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<!-- EDIT418 SECTION "Newlib" [7853-10020] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit419"><a name="m4_library" id="m4_library">M4 library</a></h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
The M4 library stores the footprints as M4 macros; there are usually several (many) footprints contained in each footprint file. The different footprints in a single file are generally variations on a single pattern (e.g. DIP-8, DIP-14, DIP-16, etc.)  The easiest way to find the correct footprint attribute name is by browsing through the “pcblib” library in the PCB library window.  The footprint attribute is given in square brackets in the description.  Also you can view the list of footprints from pcblib at the <a href="http://www.gedasymbols.org/footprints/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.gedasymbols.org/footprints/"  rel="nofollow">gEDA Symbols webpage</a>.
</p>

<p>
The following m4 libraries have received more attention and improvements than the others:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> ~amp for Amp connectors</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> ~amphenol for Amphenol connectors</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> ~geda for many diverse parts used in basic design using gEDA (resistors, caps, etc).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> ~bourns for products like trim pots from Bourns</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> ~cts for products like resistor packs from CTS</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> ~johnstech for Johnstech sockets</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> ~minicircuits for Minicircuits specific footprints</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> ~panasonic for some Panasonic specific footprints</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Finally, for both the newlib and the M4 lib, it is extremely important that you verify that the footprint name you use instantiates *exactly* the footprint you want when you place it in PCB. Therefore, it is critical to inspect the footprint before you use it. You can verify the footprint you want to use by clicking on it in the “footprint library” window, and then placing it onto an empty spot in PCB’s drawing area. Manually inspect the footprint to ensure that it has the correct number of pins/pads, correct dimensions, etc.
</p>

<p>
Also, once you generate Gerber files, make sure you <a href="geda-pcb_tips.html#i_m_done_with_my_layout._how_should_i_check_my_design" class="wikilink1" title="geda-pcb_tips.html">inspect all footprints instantiated in your Gerbers</a> using gerbv (or an equivalent Gerber viewer) before you send your design out for fabrication.

For example, an opamp may be DIP8 or SO8. A resistor may be 0603, 0805, 1208, or through-hole. How do I know what package and footprint to use, and how do I manage the choices?
</p>

<p>
First off, the footprint you should use is a decision for you to make, not your CAD tool. It is up to you to choose your preferred package type/footprint, and then attach the correct footprint attribute to the component in the schematic. Once you have chosen which package (and footprint) you wish to use, then either <a href="geda-pcb_tips.html#where_can_i_get_pre-drawn_footprints_for_pcb" class="wikilink1" title="geda-pcb_tips.html">find an appropriate footprint</a>, or <a href="geda-pcb_tips.html#how_do_i_draw_a_new_footprint" class="wikilink1" title="geda-pcb_tips.html">draw one yourself</a> and save it in a local directory.

<p>
As far as managing the footprint choices (and indeed the large number of component attributes you are likely to have): Use <a href="geda-faq-attribs.html#help_my_design_has_hundreds_of_components_and_it_s_a_pain_to_use_gschem_to_attach_all_my_attributes" class="wikilink1" title="geda-faq-attribs.html">gattrib</a>.

<div class="level2">

<p>
The origin of a footprint is marked with a little diamond. To move it to some other position relative to the footprint you have to modify all coordinates. This can be done manually with a text editor. If you want to do it from within the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>, you need to break the footprint into pieces and assemble it again. See above for a detailed checklist. Note, that the position of the diamond is determined by the position of cross hair when copying to the buffer.

<p>
Yes, this is tedious. The reason for it is the lack of a real footprint editing mode in pcb. You are invited to write one.

You can use the “onsolder” flag to place pads on the opposite side of the
board. You would have something like this for a connector on both sides of the board:

<code>Pad[-40000 -7000 -40000 7000 2700 2400 3000 “B1” “B1” “square”]</code><br/>

If you draw the footprint with pcb-<acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> and do <strong><em>Buffer</em></strong> → <strong><em>Convert buffer to element</em></strong>, the lines on the second layer become pads with the onsolder flag.

The footprint path that PCB uses is defined using the <strong><code>Pcb.elementPath</code></strong> variable in the app-defaults file named <strong><code>PCB</code></strong>.

<div class="level2">

<p>
I prefer to place all “production-ready” footprints in a single directory that is not in the gEDA/PCB install tree. When a new version of gEDA/PCB comes out I do not make any changes to project files or libraries. If there are newlib footprints in the PCB library that I want to use I copy them to the “production-ready” footprint directory.
</p>

<p>
Rather than change configuration files to get gsch2pcb to find the footprints I create a wrapper script called <strong><code>sch2pcb</code></strong> that contains the footprint path. All users use the same script and access the same production footprints.
</p>

<p>
To use the <strong><code>sch2pcb</code></strong> script that is listed below replace the string <strong><code>FOOTPRINT_DIR</code></strong> with your footprint directory:
</p>
<pre class="code">#!/bin/bash
gsch2pcb --elements-dir FOOTPRINT_DIR $@</pre>

<p>
Or another user&#039;s version:
</p>
<pre class="code">#!/bin/bash
#this script was written by John Luciani
gsch2pcb --elements-dir /home/user/pcb/footprints/user --use-files $@</pre>

<p>
Alternatively you can make use of a project file which gsch2pcb reads for its options. For example the file <code>myproject</code> could look like this:
</p>
<pre class="code">schematics myschematic.sch myschematic2.sch
elements-dir /myfootprintdir
output-name mypcb
skip-m4</pre>

<p>
The example file searches through <code>myfootprintdir</code> for footprints used in <code>myschematic.sch</code> and <code>myschematic2.sch</code> and creates <code>mypcb.pcb</code> skipping m4 style footprints. gsch2pcb is then called with the project file as an option.

The mouse is only sensitive to components on the active side of the board. This prevents ambiguities with components placed on both, top and bottom.  By default, top side is active and the bottom side is the “far side” whose components are ignored by the mouse. You can swap the roles of the sides to make components on the far side accessible. The key-accels [tab], [shift-tab], [ctrl-tab] and [ctrl-shift-tab] will do the trick. These accels combine the swap with different vertical and horizontal flips.

Although only one silk layer button is visible in the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>, silkscreen for both sides is automatically configured. In default view the silk layer button refers to silkscreen on the component side of the board. To place text or lines on solder silk you have to flip the board with the tab key (or shift-tab if you prefer a left-right flip). This is like physically turning the board to the other side. It turns the solder layer on top, and component layer on bottom. Objects on component silk layer
will be greyed out. If you draw to silk, lines will always go to the current top silk layer, which is solder now. The same happens to components and their silk screen. Flip the board again to return to default view.

<div class="level2">

<p>
In pcb vias are covered by soldermask by default. You can achieve open vias by setting their clearance value to a proper value. This can be done individually for every object, or collectively for selections of objects.
</p>

<p>
For individual vias:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Turn on the soldermask layer. This will make the k key refer to the soldermask clearance instead of polygon clearance.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Position the mouse above the via (mouse cursor will change in recent versions of pcb)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Type [<strong><code>k</code></strong>] several times until soldermask clearance exceeds the diameter of the via pad. Every strike of the key will increase the clearance by 2 mil. The first strike will let the pad of the via pop through the soldermask color. Yet, the actual clearance is only 2 mil at this point. You can decrease the clearance by using the [<strong><code>&lt;shift&gt;-K</code></strong>] key.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For groups of vias:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Turn on the solder mask layer.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> select the all the vias you want to clear from soldermask. You may switch off all the other layers to conveniently collect exclusively the vias.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Type [<strong><code>&lt;ctrl&gt;-K</code></strong>] key several times. [<strong><code>&lt;shift&gt;-&lt;ctrl&gt;-K</code></strong>] will decrease the clearance of all selected objects.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The command interface provides more control over the actual size of the clearance. Type ”:” to get the command line window, then type:
</p>
<pre class="code">ChangeClearSize(SelectedVias, &lt;delta&gt;)</pre>

<p>
where <code>&lt;delta&gt;</code> is a size given in 1/100 of a mil. Thus the number 3000 corresponds to 30 mil. Simple integers for <code>&lt;delta&gt;</code> will set the clearance to this value. If the value is preceded by a minus ”-” or a plus ”+” the clearance will be decreased or increased. This also works with <code>SelectedPins</code>, <code>SelectedPads</code>, <code>SelectedLines</code>, <code>SelectedArcs</code> or even <code>SelectedObjects</code>.

<p>
By default holes and pads will be cleared by an amount given in the corresponding footprint file. Sometimes this clearance might not be what your design needs. You can change the clearance on the fly for individual holes and pads just like vias. See the paragraph above for the details. If pad clearance is not compatible with the demands of your pcb-fab you may consider to make local copies of the footprint files and change the clearance accordingly.

A “thermal via” is not a via with a thermal relief.  Rather, it&#039;s a via with no thermal relief punched into polygons on both sides of the board.  These vias get filled with solder to help create a large thermal mass to be used as a heat sink.  For more info, see Freescale App-Note AN4005.

<p>
You are likely drawing tracks with auto-DRC on. To connect the two segments, here are some suggestions:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> DRC enforcement uses the ratsnest to determine where a track is allowed to go. Thus, you must have the ratsnest drawn in order to make connections in auto-DRC mode. Otherwise you will not be allowed to connect (or approach) any copper that is not already connected to your net. (If the rat visibility bothers you, you can hide the rats layer – but the rats must exist).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You should also refresh the rats regularly when drawing. Hit [<strong><code>o</code></strong>] to redraw/re-optimize the rats. Make sure a rat is visibly connecting the two pieces of metal you want to connect.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> It is also possible that you will experience this situation when drawing tracks between pins in a connector. In this case, it is possible that your track width violates the clearance requirements of the pin field. Try decreasing the pin-to-metal clearance, or use a narrower track width.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Sometimes this route-blocking behaviour can come about from an error in your netlist.  Don&#039;t end refdes&#039;s with lower case letters - they&#039;re reserved for gates within devices.  End with upper case or a digit; the lowercase letters are simply ignored.</div>

<p>
This is a known weakness of the Auto-enforce-DRC mode. In this mode, the line tool will only allow you to connect to copper with the same net as the place where the track started.
</p>

<p>
There are two ways to connect to unconnected copper, anyway: Obviously, you can temporarily deactivate <strong><em>Auto enforce DRC clearance</em></strong> in the <strong><em>Settings</em></strong> menu. A second way uses the fact that auto-DRC relies on the found flag:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> enter the “line” mode ([<strong><code>F2</code></strong>]).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> hover the mouse cursor over the unconnected copper.</div>

<p>
Unfortunately, older versions of PCB not only prevent you from placing overlapping vias but drop them on load. In December 2010 this overly cautious behavior was fixed. If you really need overlapping vias, you have to install a version of pcb younger than that.
</p>

<p>
The 2011 version of PCB still won&#039;t allow you to place vias so close that their holes overlap. However, it won&#039;t complain if you managed to work-around this restriction. E.g. place tiny vias and increase their size afterwards.

<div class="level2">

<p>
Most likely you named them such that PCB believes they are one part. Lower case letters at the end of a refdes are ignored. Thus, the components U2foo and U2bar both look like U2 to pcb. When building the rat nests pcb is will look for nets to U2 that, of course don&#039;t exist. Lower case letters are meant to differentiate slots of a multi-component. E.g. the four opamp symbols of a quad operational amplifier.<br/>

Bottom line: Don&#039;t use lower case letters at the end of a refdes, unless you know what you are doing.

If you don&#039;t like to use PCB confined to the area of the board, i.e. if you want margins around your board, then add them in the GIMP.  I like to make a 1.00000 inch margin around the board.  When you set your PCB size in PCB, you&#039;ll want to add the margin area.  CTRL-M will help you verify the scaling.  Also, the time to correct distortions from your scanner, or from your drawing is before you load it, in the GIMP or the like.

In pcb, the polygon itself has no built-in clearance. It is the tracks, pads and pins that bear this property. This means, you can adjust the clearance individually:
</p>

<p>
Make sure, the soldermask layer is not active. Else the following will apply to the soldermask rather than to the polygon. Press [<code>k</code>] to increase the clearance of the object under the cursor. Use [<code>ctrl-k</code>] to increase the clearance of selected objects. Add the [<code>shift</code>] modifier to decrease the clearance. To change a whole track press [<code>f</code>] to find all segments that are connected to the object under the cursor and apply the action <code>select(connection)</code>.
</p>

<p>
The amount of the increment can be configured in the dialog <strong><em>File</em></strong> → <strong><em>Preferences…</em></strong> → <strong>Increments</strong>. (Note, this setting is currently ignored)
</p>

<p>
The above only applies to one object at a time. You can manipulate the clearance of all selected objects with the action <code>ChangeClearSize(Selected,&lt;amount&gt;,&lt;unit&gt;)</code>. The parameter <code>&lt;amount&gt;</code> should be a number. A prefixed sign means increment, or decrement. A prefixed <code>=</code> sets the clearance to the following value. The parameter can be <code>mil</code> or <code>mm</code>. If not specified the units will default to the internal unit of 0.01 mil.
</p>

<p>
In addition, there is a special action that acts only on objects with clearance below a given minimum: <code>MinClearGap(Selected,&lt;amount&gt;,&lt;unit&gt;)</code>.

There are four basic ways to edit polygon outlines. You can move and delete vertices and you can insert vertices using two techniques. Polygons can be edited equally well in “thin line draw” mode (<strong><em>Settings</em></strong> → <strong><em>Thin draw poly</em></strong>) or in normal mode. Moving a vertex is easily accomplished by un-selecting your polygon and then clicking and dragging that vertex to a new location. To delete a vertex, a corner in your polygon, put your crosshairs over the point and hit ‘delete’ on the keyboard. To insert a vertex, you’ll use the insert tool (’insert’ keystroke). Start by clicking the edge you want to split with a new point. Click and drag a new point into the polygon. A variation on this technique is 1) click to select, followed by 2) click to place new vertex.
</p>

<p>
(NOTE: Inserting points into polygon will generally work ONLY with “all direction lines” enabled (<strong><em>Settings</em></strong> → <strong><em>&#039;All direction&#039; lines</em></strong>). This is because PCB has a powerful 45/90 degree constraints system. If you try to insert new vertices into a polygon that don’t fall onto lines of proper 45 and 90 degree constraints, PCB disallows the action!)

<div class="level2">

<p>
Often it’s useful to have vias connect completely to a polygon (a field of copper) for heat transfer – the apparent problem is that PCB polygons have only a single “clear pins/vias” flag for the entire polygon (toggled by the [<strong><code>s</code></strong>] key). Our goal is to only connect some of the pins/vias to the polygon, but to connect them better than a thermal does. Here are a few ways to do this:
</p>

<p>
One way, you’ll make an object that’s almost just like a thermal in that it goes between your via and the polygon – the difference is that you’ll actually create an annulus to completely fill the space between the hole and polygon (which because it’s clearance is turned on, is not connected to the pin). This annulus is four arc segments. You can copy these four items to the buffer to create a “zero-clearance thermal tool”. The drawback of this trick is that when you change via size, you’ll also have to modify the size of these filler parts.
</p>

<p>
The arcs allow you to use this fill trick in tight places by only placing, say two of the four arcs.
</p>

<p>
Another trick is to make a zero-length line. Take a single line segment and move the end-point on top of the start-point. Now you have a “single point line” (a circle) with the diameter equal to the line thickness. Move to different layers ([<strong><code>m</code></strong>] key) as you see fit. Place this object centered on your via to connect it to a polygon.
</p>

<p>
Power-users may want to keep a small custom library of these parts by saving them as elements. It’s also handy to put these “parts” in one of your PCB buffers so they’re at your fingertips.
</p>

<p>
You can also add another polygon on-top of the polygon to which you want to connect you vias. You’ll un-set the “clear pins/vias” flag and the vias will be connected to the larger polygon underneath.

<div class="level2">

<p>
The reason is that pins usually have sufficient spacing that the plane surrounding them remains intact on all sides and pads usually are so tightly spaced that they do not. Because of this you must manually draw the thermal “fingers” to connect the pad to the ground plane. Be sure that you have the settings such that new lines connect to planes when you draw them. If you need to make several such thermals, spend a little time making the first one just the way you want then copy the fingers to the buffer and paste it where you want the others.

<div class="level2">

<p>
It&#039;s all just names when you&#039;re doing single sided.  There&#039;s no such
thing as a single sided board in pcb - just a double sided board with nothing
on one side.
</p>

<p>
Design for two-sided, but with all the traces on the solder side. If you use
the autorouter, turn off all but the bottom layer. This will make the autorouter
stick to that layer. If you need wire jumpers, you have two options to let pcb know
there is a valid connection: You can draw tracks on top layer similar to a two layer
layout. Alternatively you can Create a “jumper” symbol in the schematic and put that 
in places where you need a jumper. This is likely to be a major pain, but you can
enforce dimensions of the jumpers this way if you care.  
</p>

<p>
Single sided boards do not have plated holes, so pad diameter for pins must be 
greater, usually two to three times the drill size. Some footprints in the default
library have very small pads which will be too weak if used for single sided board.
Tweak them to your needs and place them in a local library.
</p>

<p>
When you dump your gerbers, delete the component side one and rename
the plated-holes one to unplated-holes.  Voila!  A single sided board.

There is a third party open source utility called <a href="http://www.pstoedit.net/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.pstoedit.net/"  rel="nofollow">pstoedit</a> that converts postscript data to pcb format. It is included in most major Linux distributions. You can use your favorite vector graphics utility to produce a logo or any kind of fancy layout. Export as eps if you can and make sure that your logo fits into the bounding box (check with a postscript viewer such as ggv). If there is no eps export available, you can produce postscript by printing to a file. In this case you may add a bounding   box with <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/gnu/6.53/Ps2epsi.htm" class="urlextern" title="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/gnu/6.53/Ps2epsi.htm"  rel="nofollow">ps2epsi</a>.

The graphics will sit somewhere on the lower left of the view port. You may have to zoom out to get it on the screen.

John Luciani wrote a pair of perl scripts that can do better than that. The script sch-matrix places multiple copies of a basic block on the sheet.

The result is a matching pair of schematic and layout with a subcircuit repeated multiple times.

<p>
Yes, you can tell pcb on the command line to do an export. All the parameters set in the print dialog can be used in the command line too. Some simple examples:
</p>

<p>
Gerber files:
</p>
<pre class="code">pcb -x gerber --gerberfile BOARD BOARD.pcb</pre>

<p>
Encapsulated Postscript:
</p>
<pre class="code">pcb -x eps --eps-file BOARD.eps</pre>

<p>
Multi page formated Postscript print:
</p>
<pre class="code">pcb -x ps --psfile BOARD.ps BOARD.pcb</pre>

<p>
<acronym title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</acronym> format:
</p>
<pre class="code">pcb -x png --dpi 300 --only-visible --outfile BOARD.png BOARD.pcb</pre>

<p>
Different output procedures allow for different options. See the output of <code>pcb --help</code> for details.

<p>
The layer-stack string can contain a comma separated list of the layers used in the <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>. You have to give the option ”--as-shown”. Else, a default layer stack file will be used. In addition there are a number of tokens that are technically no layers  like “pins”, or “invisible”. If you put an unknown token in the layer-stack string, pcb responds with a list of known layer names.

<div class="level2">

<p>
PCB interprets the lines in a layer called ‘outline’ as the absolute edge of the pcb. If no such layer is present, you can either rename a layer (<strong><em>Edit</em></strong> → <strong><em>Edit name of</em></strong> → <strong><em>active layer</em></strong>). Or you can add a layer from scratch (<strong><em>File</em></strong> → <strong><em>Preferences…</em></strong> → <strong>Layers</strong> → <code>Add</code>) and rename it accordingly. Note, that the name of this layer is case sensitive.
</p>

<p>
You can enter your outline thru PCB’s <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>. You just draw the desired outline with the line tool or the arc too. Most fabs will cut the board at the center of the lines. You can generate boards of any shape this way. Arcs, polygons and text in the outline layer also enter the gerber file. 
</p>

<p>
It’s also possible to edit the native .pcb file format of your layout. I usually use layer 8 for outlines:
</p>
<pre class="code">Layer(8 &quot;outline&quot;)
(
	Line[x1 y1 x2 y2 1000 2000 0x00000000]
	Line[x2 y2 x3 y3 1000 2000 0x00000000]
	Line[x3 y3 x4 y4 1000 2000 0x00000000]
	Line[x4 y4 x1 y1 1000 2000 0x00000000]
	Line[&lt;more points go here for non-square boards&gt; 1000 2000 0x00000000]
)</pre>

<p>
PCB will produce a gerber file called $NAME.outline.gbr that exclusively contains the objects in the outline layer.

<div class="level2">

<p>
Some fabs provide lists of standard drill sizes and charge extra if the design
contains additional sizes. You can put this list in a “vendor resource file”.
This file may also exceptions and specify if the nearest diameter should be
chosen, or rounded up to the next size in the list. See
<a href="http://pcb.geda-project.org/pcb-cvs/pcb.html#Vendor-drill-mapping" class="urlextern" title="http://pcb.geda-project.org/pcb-cvs/pcb.html#Vendor-drill-mapping"  rel="nofollow">the section Vendor-drill-mapping</a> in the pcb manual for the syntax of this file. 
</p>

<p>
Load the file to pcb with <strong><em>File</em></strong> → <strong><em>Load vendor resource file</em></strong>. Alternatively, you can use with the command <code>:LoadVendor(drillfile)</code>. Substitute “drillfile” with the name of your file.
</p>

<p>
On load, pcb will substitute drill sizes so that the layout conforms to the list. If you want to apply an already loaded vendor resource file again, you can do <strong><em>Apply vendor drill mapping</em></strong> from the <strong><em>Connects</em></strong> menu.

Besides running the DRC checker, it is essential to check your Gerber files. The gEDA Suite includes the program “gerbv” for this task. Here are some things to check/verify:

<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Check that all trace widths are the correct size. Also make sure your trace widths and metal-metal separations are above the minimum specified by your PCB vendor.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Check that all hole diameters are called out at the correct size.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Check that metal annular rings around holes/vias are large enough. The annular ring is the distance between the hole’s edge and the outer diameter of the metallization. The annular ring must be large enough to accommodate drill location + layer registration + other manufacturing inaccuracy. This information should be available from your PCB fabrication house; they normally publish the minimum annular ring requirements in their manufacturing rules document.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Check that your antipads (clearance around holes/vias) are large enough. This information should be available from your PCB fabrication house; ask them for their manufacturing rules document.</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Do a visual sanity check of all layers. Nothing detailed, just does it look approximately like you think it should.</div>
</li>

</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Are all layers negative/positive as they should be? Note that some fab houses want positive layers only. PCB will automatically create negative Gerbers on outer layer planes with no tracks. If you want an all-plane layer to be output as a positive layer, draw a single track somewhere in an unused part of the plane. This will trigger PCB to render that layer as a positive layer.</div>
