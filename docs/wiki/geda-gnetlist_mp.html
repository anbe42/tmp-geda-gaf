NAME
       gnetlist - gEDA/gaf Netlist extraction/generation

SYNOPSIS
       gnetlist	 [-i] [-I] [-q] [-s] [-v] [-l schem_file] [-m schem_file ] [-g
       guile_procedure] [-c scheme_string ]  [-o  output_filename]  schematic1
       [... schematicN]

DESCRIPTION
       gnetlist	 is  the  netlist  extraction/generation program which is part
       gEDA (GPL Electronic Design Automation) toolset.	 This program takes  a
       schematic for its input and outputs a netlist.

       gnetlist	 depends heavily on guile (a scheme based scripting language).
       It uses guile to define the output format.  Basically gnetlist reads  a
       schematic,  creates  an	internal representation of the various connec-
       tions, and then a guile	script	extracts  the  connections  into  some
       netlist format.

       gnetlist is very much so a work in progress.  Currently it supports the
       following backends:

	       1) Allegro netlist format (-g allegro)

	       2) BAE netlist format (-g bae)

	       3) BOM / BOM2 - Bill of Materials (-g bom and -g bom2)

	       4) Partslist 1,2,3 - More Bill of Materials (-g partslist[1-3])

	       5) DRC - Start of a design rule checker (-g drc)

	       6) DRC2 - A second design rule checker (-g drc2)

	       7) gEDA - native format, mainly used for testing (-g geda)

	       8) Gossip netlist format (-g gossip)

	       9) PADS netlist format (-g pads)

	       10) PCB / PCBboard (-g PCB and -g PCBboard)

	       11) gsch2pcb backend (-g gsch2pcb)

	       12) ProtelII netlist format (-g protelII)

	       13) Spice compatible netlist format (-g spice)

	       14) Enhanced spice compatible netlist format (-g spice-sdb)

	       15) Switcap netlist format (-g switcap)

	       16) Tango netlist format (-g tango)

	       17) Verilog code (-g verilog)

	       18) VHDL code (-g vhdl)

	       19) VIPEC netlist format (-g vipec)

	       20) Bartels Autoengineer netlist format (-g bae)

	       21) GOSSIP system simulation system netlist format (-g gossip)

	       22) MAXASCII netlist format (-g maxascii)

	       23) VHDL-AMS netlist format (-g vams)

	       24) Futurenet2 netlist format (-g futurenet2 )

	       25)  SWITCAP  switched  capacitor  simulator netlist format (-g
       switcap )

	       26) RF Cascade netlist format (-g cascade )

	       27) RACAL-REDAC netlist format (-g redac )

	       28) PCB actions file for forward annotating pin/pad names  from
		schematic to layout (-g pcbpins)


       For more info on these formats please look at the README.*

       Please  read  the  official  (non-existant) documentation on how to use
       gnetlist, since this man page just describes the command line arguments
       and a few examples on how to run gnetlist.


OPTIONS
       gnelist accepts the following options:

       -q      Quiet  mode  on.	  This	mode turns off all warnings/notes/mes-
	       sages. (optional)

       -v      Verbose mode on.	 This mode gives as much feedback to the  user
	       as possible. (optional)

       -g guile_procedure
	       Specify	the  guile  procedure  which is executed to create the
	       netlist.

       -o output_filename
	       Specify the filename which will contain the  netlist  generated
	       by gnetlist.  If this option is not specified the default file-
	       name is &quot;output.net&quot;.

       -l scheme_file
	       Specify a filename which contains scheme code to be loaded  and
	       execute	before	any  backend  is loaded or any guile procedure
	       (using -g flag) is executed.  This flag can be specified multi-
	       ple times and can be used to pass information to backends.

       -m scheme_file
	       Specify	a filename which contains scheme code to be loaded and
	       execute after the backend is loaded but still before any	 guile
	       procedure (using -g flag) is executed.  This flag can be speci-
	       fied multiple times and can be  used  to	 pass  information  to
	       backends.   This flag, for example, allows the user to override
	       variables inside of the backends (such as paths).

       -c string
	       Pass the specified  string  to  the  guile  interpreter.	  This
	       allows  you to execute arbitrary guile scripts from the command
	       line.  Be sure to surround the string  with  either  single  or
	       double  quotes  to  satisfy  your shell.	 The string is execute
	       before any init or netlist backend scheme  code	is  loaded  or
	       executed.

       -I      Put  .INCLUDE &lt;filename&gt; in output file instead of model file’s
	       contents.

       -i      Interactive mode.  After the schematic is read  in  and	parsed
	       then  go	 into  interactive  mode.  Interactive mode allows the
	       user to execute guile procedures directly.

       -s      Sort output netlist (for Gnucap)

       schematic1 [... schematicN]
	       At least one schematic file must	 be  specified.	  If  multiple
	       schematics are specified then they are sequentially read in and
	       parsed with the assumption that they are all part of  the  same
	       design.	 It  is important that the schematic(s) follow all the
	       options (ie last).


EXAMPLES
       These examples assume that you have a stack_1.sch in the current direc-
       tory.

       gnetlist	 requires  that	 at least one schematic to be specified on the
       command line:

	    ./gnetlist stack_1.sch

       This is not very useful since it does not direct gnetlist to do
       anything.

       Specify a guile procedure name to get gnetlist to output a netlist:

	    ./gnetlist -g geda stack_1.sch

       The netlist output will be written to a file called &quot;output.net&quot;
       in the current working directory.

       You can specify the output filename by using the -o flag:

	    ./gnetlist -g geda stack_1.sch -o stack.netlist

       The spice backend is run against the schematic(s) if you specify
       -g spice and the tango backend is run if you specify -g tango.

       To interact with the guile interpreter:

	    ./gnetlist -i stack_1.sch

       You will get a prompt where you can execute guile procedures.

       To get a more verbose feedback as to what gnetlist is doing run
       with the -v flag:

	    ./gnetlist -v -g geda stack_1.sch


ENVIRONMENT
       No environment variables are used.
