<h5><a name="ipc_footprint_calculator" id="ipc_footprint_calculator">IPC Footprint Calculator</a></h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
 Build a footprint calculator that can take the IPC rules and produce a pcb footprint. Preferably write this in a way where the core program is independent of a gui so that you can script it for generating entire large families of footprints or hook it up to a <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> of choice (lesstif, gtk, maybe even cgi). Would require the purchase of IPC-7351 (approximately U.S.A. $100)and verifying that one is allowed to produce such a calculator.

<div class="level5">

<p>
 IPC-D-356 is a specification for a netlist output format used for manufacturing test of PCBs.  It specifies both connectivity as well as pad position information, thereby facilitating the use of automated testing after PCB manufacture.  In this project, you would implement an exporter which would write an IPC-D-356 compliant file from within PCB.  The IPC-D-356 <acronym title="specification">spec</acronym> is available at: <a href="http://www.solidigm.com/downloads/ipc356.pdf" class="urlextern" title="http://www.solidigm.com/downloads/ipc356.pdf"  rel="nofollow">http://www.solidigm.com/downloads/ipc356.pdf</a>

<h5><a name="recently_loaded_file_list" id="recently_loaded_file_list">Recently loaded file list</a></h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
 Presently pcb does not present a list of recently loaded files in the file menu. It would be nice if pcb kept track of the last few files a user loaded. This is a common feature found in other programs.

<h5><a name="remember_dialog_size_and_positions" id="remember_dialog_size_and_positions">Remember dialog size and positions</a></h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
 pcb dialogs should remember their size and position. Some of pcb’s dialogs remember their size, but this isn’t universal. Several users have complained since they have to reposition and/or resize the dialog boxes every time they are opened.
