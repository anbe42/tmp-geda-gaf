    build-sys: Don't use AC_HEADER_DIRENT.
    
    The Autoconf manual says that AC_HEADER_DIRENT is now unnecessary:
    
         This macro is obsolescent, as all current systems with directory
         libraries have `dirent.h'.  New programs need not use this
         macro.
    
    This patch removes AC_HEADER_DIRENT and all checks for HAVE_DIRENT_H.
    It turned out that in most of the places where `dirent.h' was being
    #include'd it wasn't needed anyway.
    
    (Fix for a Cygwin build bug reported by Dan McMahill).

    build-sys: Improve HTML conversion rules.
    
    We want to make sure the HTML version of the man pages is always
    distributed, but make building/installing it optional (in case users
    don't have a proper groff installed).
    
    This can be achieved by making sure that Automake only tries to
    install the HTML man pages if a working groff is available.  In
    addition, `make distcheck' is set up to behave as if groff is not
    installed.
    
    Unfortunately, this still isn't ideal, because users who build from a
    source archive (with pre-built HTML) won't get HTML installed unless
    they have a working groff.
    
    In the long run, what needs to happen is to use a mechanism like
    `missing' to handle rebuilding of HTML man pages -- or just drop HTML
    man pages altogether.

    gsch2pcb: Check for and reject non-footprint PCB files.
    
    A common error is to save a footprint from PCB as a layout rather than
    as an element.  This patch modifies gsch2pcb to attempt to check for
    this error. If a layout file is detected, it is rejected and a warning
    printed.

    More Makefile.am cleanup
    
    Details on this commit:
    * Removed even more trace of the old prototype mechanism from the Makefiles.
    * Removed the cleanup of configure scripts which are no longer there (or
      for that matter were never in the same directory as some of these
      Makefiles).
    * Removal of some files from the *CLEANFILES rules which never existed.
    * Line length tweaks and fixes

    Trimmed the filename length of some gxyrs output files
    
    make distcheck was having some path length issues with the renamed files
    in this commit.  More specifically, tar was complaining the path length
    exceeded some sort of limit, which eventually caused make distcheck to fail
    badly.  This bug was ticked by the next commit (where the package name was
    lengthened).

    Makefile.am cleanup (removal of ChangeLog and Makefile.in files)
    
    Details on this commit:
    * Now that we are no longer storing machine generated ChangeLogs inside
      the git repository, make maintainer-clean should remove the machine
      generated ChangeLogs.  This way nobody accidently edits the ChangeLog.
      Only 7 ChangeLogs are left after a make maintainer-clean (intl, po,
      and one toplevel ChangeLog).
    * Some directories were missing the removal of Makefile.in when make
      maintainer-clean is run.  Only 3 Makefile.in files remain now after
      make maintainer-clean (only in the intl directories).
    * Removed $Id$ tags from some of the Makefiles since we are no longer
      using CVS.
    * Removed some unnecessary ChangeLogs from ever being created (from
      example/gTAG gschem/scripts, and symbol/font).
    
    Note 1: There are still some machine generated files still hanging around,
    but I'm going to leave those alone for now as the .gitignore mechanism
    properly masks those.
    
    Note 2: Made sure that all files that are to be removed in the *CLEANFILES
    lists comes before the #*# otherwise they will be ignored.

    The old prototype.h creation mechanism hasn't been used in years and now
    has been fully removed.  Also removed common/outputs/Makefile.am since it
    no longer used either.

    The only file which I might want to not distribute is update-version.sh,
    which technically is a developer/maintainer only file, but for now I'll
    include it.  Also libgeda/docs/images isn't integrated into the build
    properly yet, so it will not be in the distribution for now.

    entering gnetlist's interactive mode -- and to be nice and quiet the rest of
    the time.

    Require Guile 1.8.0 or newer.
    
    Guile 1.8 became the stable branch of Guile on 2006-02-12, over three
    *years* ago. All major distributions ship it, including Debian stable.
    
    Expecting its availability makes testing of new Scheme-based features
    much easier, as most gEDA developers normally write and test code
    against 1.8. Furthermore, it allows better advantage to be taken of
    1.8-only features (such as improvements in debugging support), without
    requiring vast swathes of hard-to-maintain preprocessor trickery.

    tragesym: put attributes on top if there are no top pins
    
    If you put pins on either the top or bottom of a symbol, tragesym
    moved the name around and changes the positioning. However, this is

    the bottom.

    Write logs to $HOME/.gEDA/logs/.
    
    Rewrite s_log_init() to put log files in a centralised location. A
    user application (e.g. gnetlist) provides a prefix, and log file is
    opened at:
    
       $HOME/.gEDA/logs/<prefix>-<YYYYmmdd>-<serial>.log       [1]
    
    The serial is found by the following procedure:
    
    1. Read through the directory to find the highest existing <serial>.
    
    2. Starting with that number, repeatedly attempt to open()
       incrementing files with O_CREAT|O_EXCL flags to guarantee that a
       new file is created.
    
    3. If after LOG_OPEN_ATTEMPTS = 5 attempts a unique filename hasn't
       been found, fail.
    
    The logic *intentionally* does not fill in gaps in the sequence -- if
    I delete logs, I still want a new log to appear at the end of the
    list.
    
    [1] The actual location is a subdirectory "logs" of the user config
        directory, which may not be ~/.gEDA on all platforms.

    should we have any spatially keyed data-structures in the future.
    
    Rename PAGE->object_list PAGE->_object_list to try and discorage any
    use of it outside libgeda (ideally, outside s_page.c) in the future.

    Comments annotated with a dates and developers initials clutter the
    code with historical details people may be reluctant to remove. Not
    all of these are still relevant, and those which are should probably
    could be kept in such a way as not to suggest code ownership. The
    commit revision log is a better place for determining authorship.

    Fix some gxyrs build problems with 'make distcheck'.
    
    'make distcheck' put the executables in a different tree than sources.
    Therefore, this script has to look in builddir directory for gxyrs
    script.
    
    As a bonus, gxyrs script location is now declared at the beginning
    of this script, and it checks if gxyrs script exists.

    gattrib, gschlas: Restore setting dummy select_func to ensure proper save
    
    The select_func function pointer (now owned and exported by libgeda) is
    assigned to OBJECT->sel_func for non-locked objects. Locking is achieved
    by setting OBJECT->sel_func to NULL, and when writing out objects, the
    locked flag is determined by comparing that that pointer to NULL.
    
    We need to keep providing a dummy function so we can differentiate
    between that and a NULL pointer. This was accidentally lost in
    commit 1aab94354f053887db67aa5702abc595795dfe82 which moved the
    select_func global variable into libgeda.

    Revert applying -Werror to compiler flags when linking with GCC (CODE!!)
    
    Depending on the gcc version, the original developers might not see the
    warning until the software gets into the end user's hands (and tries
    building it with an older/newer version of gcc).  Most warnings are
    not catastropic, but by using -Werror they are _all_ catastropic.
    
    If a developer wants to get rid of all warnings, they should either:
    
     1) run make -s and see/fix all the warnings, and/or
     2) modify the Makefile's themselves and add the -Werror flag temporarily.
    
    (Comments explaining rationale snipped out of an email from Ales).

    utils: Adjust Makefile.am so we add $(AM_CFLAGS) to {appname}_CFLAGS
    
    This allows us to add CFLAGS to all targets from the AM_CFLAGS variable.
    
    Also export app-specific CFLAGS from configure.ac for gmk_sym,
    smash_megafile, convert_sym, sarlacc_schem and olib rather than
    copying those for gschlas inside Makefile.am. This keeps things
    cleaner should either set of CFLAGS need to change in the future.

    (accidental) commit relating to these CFLAGS.

    Use pkg-config support for Guile if present.
    
    Using pkg-config allows easier cross-compilation, since the build
    process can use a pkg-config binary native to the build machine with .pc
    files for the host machine.

    Fix non-literal format strings which cause compiler warnings.
    
    We should be careful to avoid passing arbitrary strings into functions
    which take printf style arguments. In that case, always use the construct
    ("%s", string) rather than passing string as the format argument.
    
    Some cases were fixed by using g_strdup instead of g_strdup_printf(),
    some simply replace printf() for puts().

    Draw func cleanup.
    
    Rather than having libgeda require other applications to provide the
    *_draw_func symbols, libgeda should provide them itself. Other
    applications should then override them as required near their call to
    libgeda_init().

    The origin of the top and bottom pin numbers and pin sequence did not have

    Fixed this relativ positions and the text alignments.

    tragesym: fixed version string handling
    
    With the commit 5a35c238f19622f8045784fa61497c80c4144fa6 a trailing " 1"
    was added to the version string. This is only correct if the source files
    do not contain that part of the version definition.
    Changed tragesym to accept both version strings "20060113 1" and
    "20060113" in the source file. Bug pointed out by Stefan Salewski.

    Before this patch, m4_pcbdir was being set from the preprocessor variable
    PCBDATADIR which was set at ./configure time.  In order to be able to move
    gsch2pcb to a different install prefix, this path has to be changable at
    run-time.  If PCBDATA is not set, then PCBDATADIR is used (previous
    behavior).

    Fix configure checks for Guile (again).
    
    The previous patch missed changing the gschem configure script
    (generated from configure.ac.in), and got the logic wrong anyway.

    This patch actually *removes* error message output from file loading
    errors is some cases.  This is for the sake of keeping the patch
    concise, and will be addressed in later patches.

    Avoid accessing (GList)->{next|priv} directly to aid debugging.
    
    Instead use g_list_{next|previous}, allowing us to catch errors where
    changing from gEDA structures which had their own next and prev pointers.
    
    To debug, edit the glist.h include file from glib, renaming the next and
    prev elements in the GList structure and macros. Recompile gEDA to see any
    bad accesses such as those where the HEAD nodes were previously skipped.

    Remove the globally exported variable_set_func.
    
    Only gattrib provided a non-NULL export of this symbol, and such imports
    into libgeda prevent libgeda being dynamically linked on some platforms.
    
    To better match the other tools in the suite, gattrib's i_vars_set() and
    i_window_vars_set() functions were combined into a single i_vars_set().

    All the promotion keywords were moved from gschem into libgeda to fix:
    [ 1748143 ] gschlas causes duplicate prompted attributes   The primary
    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were
    not being setup by gschlas and so duplicate refdes attributes were
    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )
    (promote-invisible ... )
    (keep-invisible ... )

    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.

    Avoid writting '\r' to files on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733826 from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    When using the "w" mode in fopen, MinGW translates LF into CR-LF.
    This creates havoc when reading the same file again, when sharing
    schematics files with other systems, and when placing them in a VCS.
    
    This can be avoided by using the "wb" mode. The "b" is ignored on
    all POSIX conforming systems, according to these sources:
    
    http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/fopen.3.html
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html
    
    There are other ways, however. Adding
    
    #include <fcntl.h>
    int _fmode = _O_BINARY;
    
    on some source file should work as well. Another way is linking
    against the MinGW supplied binmode.o, which does exactly that.
