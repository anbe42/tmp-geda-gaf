Installation instructions 

Please see the end of this file for platform / vendor specific hints and 
tips.  Also please read the README file in this same directory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick Ref:

% ./configure 
% make 
% make install

In order to build gschem you must install the following packages first:

	GLIB 2.4.x
	GTK+ 2.4.x and all dependancies
	guile 1.6.x or later
	libgeda (match version and must be installed first)
	symbols
	LibStroke 0.5.1  (optional)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
More detailed info:

- To compile gschem with gtk+ installed in some system directory (/usr/local 
  for example) type:


		./configure		(This should guess everything right)
					(e-mail me if it doesn't)	
		make all

  Run: configure --help for more options (such as overriding the default
  prefix).

  You can specify where rc files are installed by using the --with-rcdir=path
  when you run ./configure.  This is useful to package maintainers who would
  like to override where gschem and friends search for the rc files.

- To install gschem into the prefix dir (and subdirs) type:

		make install

  in gschem's top level directory


gEDA uses GNU Libtool in order to build shared libraries on a
variety of systems. While this is very nice for making usable
binaries, it can be a pain when trying to debug a program. For that
reason, compilation of shared libraries can be turned off by
specifying the `--disable-shared' option to `configure'.

The configure script should figure out most system dependant things, but at
this point I'm either not taking into account what configure figures out or 
I have missed some system dependance.  So please e-mail me at: 
ahvezda@geda.seul.org


- Disabling strokes

  If configure finds libstroke installed it will automatically enable 
  stroke support.  To disable this run configure like:

	./configure --disable-strokes

  Then do:  

	make clean 
	make all


- Uninstall

  To uninstall a previous version (or the current version) of gEDA type:

	make uninstall

  in the top level gEDA source directory.  This will remove installed files 
  which belong to gEDA.


Platform / Vendor specific tips and hints
------------------------------------------

- libc5 (SuSE) 

	If you get the following error message:

	 "link: '-L' cannot specify a relative directory"

  There is a problem with readline and guile.  Please hide (rename) 
  libreadline.so.* (move it out of wherever it is installed) and rebuild
  guile again.  Then recompile gEDA and things should work right.

- Redhat 6.0

  The guile RPMs that are shipped with RedHat 6.0 has been giving some 
  people some trouble.  The solution seems to grab either the SRPMS and
  build that or get the guile-1.3.tar.gz file and build guile manually.

- libstroke 
	
	Be sure you do not compile libstroke with MOUSE_DROPPINGS defined;
	it won't work at all with gschem.  You would have had to manually
	define MOUSE_DROPPINGS, so if you just followed the build 
	instructions you should be okay.  
	

- SunOS / Solaris 

	If you have problems running the shell script wrappers (when
	running ./gschem or any of the other programs), try changing
	the shell to /bin/ksh (or where ksh is).  /bin/sh is known to
	be of lesser quality on Solaris.

	Also run ./configure --disable-shared if you have to problems
	running programs because a shared library isn't be found/loaded.
